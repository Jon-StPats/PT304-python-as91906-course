"""01 — Variables and Data Types

Goal: Translate what you already know from JavaScript into Python.

Python basics:
- No `let` / `const` keywords.
- Indentation matters.
- Use # for comments.

Run this file:
- VS Code terminal:  python 01_basics/variables.py

# --- Examples ---
name = "Alex"          # str
age = 17               # int
height_m = 1.72        # float
is_student = True      # bool

print("Examples:")
print(name, age, height_m, is_student)

# --- TODO 1 ---
# Create a variable called score and set it to an integer.
# Then print it.
# score = ???

# --- TODO 2 ---
# Ask the user for their favourite subject (input returns a string).
# Store it in a variable and print a friendly message.
# Example output: "Nice! I like Maths too."

# --- TODO 3 ---
# Convert the user's age (input) into an integer and print their age next year.
# Hint: int("17") becomes 17.

# --- EXTENSION ---
# Create a simple 'profile' output using f-strings.
# Example: print(f"Name: {name} | Age: {age}")
